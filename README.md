# FunLearn Privacy Policy

I take privacy very seriously. This is why I try to collect as little information as possible for the apps I develop.

To the best of my knowledge, this app is not programmed to collect any personally identifiable information whatsoever.

- This app contains in-app ads.
- This app requires access to the internet in order to display the `Webview` for equations.
